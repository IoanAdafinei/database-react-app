# database-react-app

To run the app you will need to have mySQL installed on your computer and import the "DatabaseExport.sql" file.
Afterwards you will need to change the files "db_name.cjs" and "db_passwd.cjs" from the "backend" folder to contain the name and password to your mySQL server.

If you don't have nodeJs installed you will need to install it.

Now you need 2 terminals, one in the backend folder and one in the client.
The one in the client needs to first run the command "npm install" and it will install all the required packages.
After that run the command "npm start" in each of the terminals. After a few seconds the app should start in your browser.
